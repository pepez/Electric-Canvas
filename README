This is my Sunday project and the original idea was to create a visual effect that looks little bit like the electric arc in Tesla coil. That is what you see in the screenshot.

Then I decided to modify it to display audio waveform from the data provided by SoundManager2. I haven't used it before so it took time to get it working properly.

Check the URL to try it out, it requires Flash 9 and should work with FF, Safari and Chrome. Music can be streamed from Jamendo if you allow it in the flash setting (cross domain access).
